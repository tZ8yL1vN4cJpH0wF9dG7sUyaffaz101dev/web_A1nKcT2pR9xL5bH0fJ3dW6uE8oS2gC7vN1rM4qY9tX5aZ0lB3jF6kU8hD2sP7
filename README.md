# 🌱 Plant Growth Tracker

A fun weekend project to track my indoor plants' growth patterns!

## 📖 Story

So I have this collection of indoor plants - pothos, snake plant, peace lily, and a few succulents. I noticed they grow differently based on the room, sunlight, and how often I forget to water them (oops 😅).

This project started as a simple Python script to log watering schedules, but then I thought - why not make it fancier? Now it:

- Takes periodic photos of plants
- Logs environmental data
- Sends me reminders when I'm being a bad plant parent

## 🌿 My Plants

| Plant | Location | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Mr. Pothos | Living Room | Thriving |
| Snake Lady | Bedroom | Indestructible |
| Lily | Kitchen | Dramatic |
| Cactus Crew | Window | Chilling |

## 🔧 How It Works

I set up a Raspberry Pi with a camera (eventually), but for now it's just scheduled scripts that run and collect data. Nothing fancy, just learning Docker and GitHub Actions along the way.

```
├── init.py          # Setup script
├── requirements.txt # Python packages
└── .github/
    └── workflows/   # Automation magic
```

## Progress
- 1st phase e stable...
- gas e fol deya suru korse...


## 🚀 Running

The workflow runs on schedule. Each "key" represents a different plant zone in my apartment.

## 📝 Notes to Self

- [ ] Actually buy a camera for the Pi
- [ ] Stop overwatering the peace lily
- [ ] Maybe add soil moisture sensors?
- [ ] Learn more about hydroponics

## 🤷 Why Public?

Honestly? To learn Git and show my friend how GitHub works. Plus, keeping myself accountable for the plant care schedule!
